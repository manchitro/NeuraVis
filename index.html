      <h1 class="mb-2">Welcome to NeuraVis!</h1>
      <p class="">
        Here we'll learn about neural networks, how they work. Don't worry if
        you're not familiar with the concepts of machine learning or neural
        networks. This guide will walk you through all of them and explain each
        in the simplest way possible!

      <h1 class="mb-2">What exaclty is a Neural Network?</h1>
      <p class="">
        Neural networks are our attempt on mimicing the workings of a biological
        brain. The word "neural" comes from neurons, the fundamental unit of a
        brain. There are billions of neurons in a human brain and there are
        trillions of connections between them. Together they can solve a lot of
        problems. Problems that might seem trivial at first. But if those same
        problems are presented to a computer, they become extremely difficult,
        or even impossible in some cases. These tasks include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speech Recognition</li>
        <li>Image Content Recognition</li>
        <li>Handwriting Recognition</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Speech Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        When you hear a family member's or a friend's voice, you can usually
        recognize them instantly. Or when you're walking through the street and
        hear your favorite songs playing, you can instantly tell which song it
        is. How does your brain do that? Well, we don't have an exact answer
        yet. The workings of a brain is still very much mysterious.
      </p>
      <img
        src="./assets/images/speech_recognition.png"
        alt=""
        class="float-right px-3"
        width="300px"
      />
      <p>
        If you try to write a comupter program to recognize a voice, the task
        suddenly becomes extremely difficult. Do I tell the computer to split up
        the audio file into different syllables? How does the program recognize
        individual syllables? Even if it can do that how do we tackle different
        accents? How do we differentiate between different person's voices?
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it seems impossible, you might already know that this has been
        done. How? That's right, through machine learning. Because of machine
        learning, we have programs that not only can turn our speech into text
        but also can recognize different voices.
      </p>
      <h3>Image Content Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        Just like recognizing speech, we have sophisticated programs that can
        see an image and tell what objects are in that image. This falls under a
        specific sector of Artificial Intelligence called Computer Vision.
      </p>
      <img
        src="./assets/images/computer_vision.png"
        alt="computer vision"
        class="img-fluid mb-4"
      />
      <p>
        As seen in the picture above, a neural network can learn to recognize
        basic shapes in street scene. We also have programs that can recognize
        person from their faces. This is called face detection and it is
        commonly used a biometric security measure.
      </p>
      <h3>Handwriting Recognition</h3>
